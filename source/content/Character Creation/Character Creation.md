### Roll Ability Scores

Roll 3d6 for each ability score (Strength, Toughness, Agility, Intelligence, Willpower, Fellowship, in order, and record them on your character sheet.
A player can decide to swap the position of one ability score that was rolled with another.
Each ability score has a Modifier which is associated with it:

| Ability Score | Modifier |
| ------------- | -------- |
| 3-4           | -2       |
| 5-7           | -1       |
| 8-13          | 0        |
| 14-16         | +1       |
| 17-18         | +2       |
### Explanation of Ability Scores
**Fellowship**
Fellowship is the measure of a character’s aptitude for leadership and the respect that others bestow on the character’s authority. It is not a measure of the appeal of a character’s personality (the player must portray the character’s personality) nor a measure of the character’s beauty. Charisma modifiers affect both the character’s ability to hire retainers and the loyalty of those retainers.
**Toughness**
Toughness is the measure of a character’s health, vitality, and overall constitution. Toughness modifiers affect a character’s Wounds and fitness for certain physical activities such as travelling long distances.
**Agility**
Agility is the measure of a character’s mobility and reflexes. Agility modifiers affect a character’s ranged and mêlée defence, ability to hit with ranged weapons, and ability to act first in combat.
**Intelligence**
Intelligence is the measure of a character’s knowledge prior to the start of play. Intelligence does not measure a character’s memory or ability to solve puzzles; it is the player’s wits that must be used in these situations. Intelligence modifiers affect the character’s ability to learn languages, are added to saving throw rolls against Magic-User spells, and for Magic-Users it affects the time (and thus expense) required to research spells and create magic items, as well as influencing the saving throws of those subject to the Magic-User’s spells.
**Strength**
Strength is a measure of a character’s raw power. Strength modifiers affect a character’s ability to hit in mêlée combat, open stuck doors, or succeed in unarmed combat.
**Willpower**
Willpower is the measure of a character’s connection to the greater universe, and the strength of the character’s spirit. Wisdom modifiers affect the character’s non-spell related saving throw rolls, and for Clerics it affects the time (and thus expense) required to research spells and create holy items, as well as influencing the saving throws of those subject to the Cleric’s spells. Willpower cannot tell if a character should flee the battle or fight to death, it is the player’s own judgement which must be used in these situations.

#### Is the character suitable?
If the total of all of the character’s ability score modifiers is less than zero, then the player may discard the character and begin the process again.

#### Roll a character class and career
Every Player Character must choose a class or roll for it. All people encountered in the game world will have a class, most with no career advances, and those are known as zero level characters. 
Class represents the social stratum of a character. First group consists of feudal classes: Warriors, Clerics and Peasants. Renaissance period introduces other classes, emerging from developing cities, cultural and social advancement. Rogues, Rangers, Townsmen and Academics belong to it. Magic-users are a special class as they form a very specific community within themselves and rarely fit well with commoners. Lastly, other races never blend with human society, and such minorities as Dwarves, Elves and Halflings always form a separate social group.
You can either choose a class, or roll using the table below.

| 2d6 roll | Class      |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 2        | Dwarf      |
| 3        | Halfling   |
| 4        | Rogue      |
| 5        | Ranger     |
| 6        | Townsman   |
| 7        | Peasant    |
| 8        | Warrior    |
| 9        | Cleric     |
| 10       | Academic   |
| 11       | Magic-user |
| 12       | Elf        |
Next, choose a career from the following table
