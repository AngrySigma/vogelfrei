For domestic retainers, Morale should be checked in any of the following cases:
* Any danger encountered during the course of Retainer's daily duties
* Anything scandalous or illegal happens
* Significant changes in Employer's behavior or appearance become obvious
* Any change in pay or living conditions
* Asked to performed duties beyond their normal job description
* The Employer is clearly not the one behind the orders
* Any other situation when the Retainer's loyalty is in question

For positions where danger is expected, the following situations trigger Morale Check:
* An opportunity arises to greatly profit at the Employer's expense
* Asked to perform obviously dangerous activity
* Other Retainers are used as cannon fodder in any way
* The Employer is clearly not the one behind the orders
* Any other situation when the Retainer's loyalty is in question

Any orders assigned by anyone except the direct employer can be freely ignored by the Retainer. For actual combat situations, see the section on Morale under the Combat section. 

It is up to the Referee what happens as a result of a failed roll, although it should have something directly to do with the retainer’s function (for example, an Accountant might embezzle his employer’s money) or the trigger of the Loyalty check (a maid might go to the authorities if she discovered criminal activity, for example).
