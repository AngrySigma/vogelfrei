In most civilized areas, it is not difficult to find people who are out of work. The Referee will determine how many qualified applicants are available for any particular position, and it generally costs about 2 sp to get word out about the job opening with additional funding raising the chance of successful applicant search.

When the applicant meets the hiring character, there are three or four factors which influence whether the applicant takes the job, and how loyal he is:
- Payment
- Employer’s Leadership
- Term of Service
- Living Quarters; if long term employment is offered

| Condition                     | Hire Rolls Modifier |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Character's Leadership        | Leadership modifier |
| 50% increase payment rate     | +1                  |
| 10% decrease payment rate     | -1                  |
| Ongoing employment, >3 months | +1                  |
| Half required living space    | -2                  |
| 50% increase living space     | +1                  |

Referee will secretly roll 3d6 twice on the following table when a character attempts to hire a retainer. The first roll will determine if the applicant accepts the position, while the second roll on the same table will determine the retainer’s Morale score. Players should never know exactly how loyal their retainers are.

| Roll | Accepts Position | Moarle |

| 3    | No               | 2      |
