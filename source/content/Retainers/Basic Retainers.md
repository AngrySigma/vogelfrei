##### Linkboy
A linkboy is a servant who is a torch/lantern bearer. They do not do heavy labor or carry equipment.
##### Laborer
Laborers do construction work, excavations, heavy lifting, and other physical sorts of labor. For every ten laborers, a foreman who is paid twice the average laborer’s wages is needed.
### Mercenary
Mercenaries are paid warriors-for-hire, treated effectively as 0 level Fighters without Career. If recruited from the citizenry, all equipment must be supplied by their employers.
##### Henchman
Henchmen are different in that they are not exactly hired help, but actually adventuring sidekicks. They also possess a Class and Career. Characters can only hire henchmen that are at least two levels below their own. Henchmen are often found during adventures as allies, and make for great replacement player characters if and when a player’s character dies.
