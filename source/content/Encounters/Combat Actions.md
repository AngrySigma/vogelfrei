Each character can perform a single action on their turn. These given options certainly do not contain an exhaustive list of possible actions. The Referee has the final say in what can or cannot be done in one Round.
##### Move
A character can move their full movement rate at any round using either normal movement speed, or running one. In case the Character is running through reach of any opponent who did not yet attack that turn, they may perform an attack against the Character.
If the Character moves their normal combat distance, they can perform a usual Attack afterwards. If the Character runs in a straight forward without obstacles at least half of their normal combat speed, they can perform a melee Attack with Charge afterwards.
##### Flee!
When one character or party is running from another, it is not merely a matter of movement rate which decides the outcome unless the chase is over open territory. Otherwise, both sides in a pursuit roll 1d20 and add their movement rate divided by 10. For example, characters with 120' movement roll d20+12. The higher roll wins. Individual rolls for those with different movement rates can be used at the Referee’s discretion. You do not have to outrun the enemy, you just have to outrun your slowest ally!

No mapping or other record keeping is allowed during a pursuit. The Referee will declare in general terms where the character goes. “You run down the corridor, past two doors, and duck to the left in a passageway,” is a perfectly fine description in a dungeon, with the character not being told details along the way. After all, the character has been running for his life with a flickering light source through hostile territory! Wilderness pursuit will be rather less mysterious of course.

Dropping items or money or treasure or food might make pursuers break off pursuit, depending on why they are pursuing. If a character drops valuable goods, or treasure, in the path of treasure-seeking enemies, those enemies must make a Morale check to stop pursuit. If an unintelligent creature is pursuing, then food is what it wants, and the appropriate food dropped causes a Morale check, with failure meaning the creature stops to eat the food. Dropping an obstacle, such as flaming oil, will normally stop pursuit as well.
##### Attack
A Character can move their normal combat speed and perform an attack any enemy within their range. To determine the attack success and the inflicted damage, the following actions are performed:
* The Referee will inform the player what the opponent's AC is. The base AC is 10 with addition of Agility Bonus. Armed Characters add their Weapon Skill to AC against melee attacks. Using a shield or wielding a secondary weapon also modifies the AC.
* The player rolls a d20 to determine if the attack lands.
* Weapon Skill and Strength Bonus are added to the roll in melee, Ballistic Skill and Agility Bonus are added to the roll in ranged combat.
* Any result equal to or greater than the defender's AC results in a successful attack.
* The difference between the result rolled and the AC is subtracted from defender's Armor Rating.
* Attacker rolls their weapon damage die and subtracts the defender's resulting Armor Rating.
Some special conditions may modify the usual attack flow:

| Special Condition                         | Modifiers                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Attacking Unaware Opponent                | +2 to hit, enemy loses all modifiers to AC                                                   |

| Attacking with Double Team                | +2 to hit                                                                                    |

| Wrestling in Team                         | +1 for each attacker, only the best roll applies                                             |
| Firing into Melee                         | -4 to hit, hit other random opponent, if the modifier makes the attack miss                  |
| Firing into the Crowd                     | +1 to hit for each target after the first one                                                |
| Attacking after Aiming Round              | +2 to hit, lose Agility Bonus to AC while Aiming                                             |
| Ranged attack against quarter cover       | +2 AC                                                                                        |
| Ranged attack against half cover          | +4 AC                                                                                        |
| Ranged attack against three-quarter cover | +7 AC                                                                                        |
| Ranged attack against full cover          | +10 AC                                                                                       |

##### Counter-attack
If a Character has just been attacked, they can  attempt to to attack the opponent in response immediately. To perform a counter-attack, a Character must answer the following conditions:
* They did not act this Round
* They are wielding a melee weapon
* They survive the attack
If a Character wields a longer weapon than the opponent, they can perform a counter-attack prior to the attacker. As an alternative, they can choose not to attack and gain +2 to AC instead against that attack.
Note that the counter-attack does not grant a free action, and finishes the actions of both the attacker and the defender.
##### Charge
If the character runs the whole distance in a straight line without obstacles, they can perform a charging attack, doing double damage, but suffering a –2AC penalty for that Round. Counter-attacking against a charging opponent with a polearm deals double damage.
#### Change Weapons and Attack
If a character is not holding the weapon that he wants to use, he can drop what is in his hands and draw a weapon (assuming the weapon is in an accessible place such as on a belt scabbard). There is a –2 penalty to hit during the Round that this happens.
##### Wrestling
A character may attempt to wrestle another character to either immobilize or take something out of that character’s hands. The attacker must have both hands free or wield a weapon effective for grappling. The defender, if he is armed and has not yet acted during the round, can immediately make an attack against the aggressor before the wrestling attempt is resolved.

Wrestling is resolved with a contested roll. Both parties roll 1d20 and apply both their Weapon Skill and Strength modifier. Ties are decided by Dexterity modifier, or a die roll if both are still tied. The winner decides whether the loser is immobilized, if he will attempt to disarm the loser of the contest, or if he releases the loser. An immobilized opponent can usually take no action other than attempting to escape on his next action, but can instead attack a grappling opponent with natural or minor weapons. Resolve this with another wrestling roll. Any character immobilized for three successive wrestling contests is considered pinned and helpless—no further attempts to escape can be made. If disarmament is attempted (and this includes snatching any held object, not just taking away weapons), the defender must make a save versus Paralyzation to keep hold of the object that his attacker is attempting to take.

If there are multiple opponents attempting to wrestle a single defender, all attackers make their rolls as normal, but only the best roll is used with a +1 bonus for each additional attacker. Creatures whose physiology or special abilities suggest that they have an advantage when grappling (tentacles, adhesive, multiple limbs) gain a further +1 bonus to their wrestling roll per Hit Die.
##### Firing into Melee
Firing into melee with a missile weapon is a very uncertain thing. If doing so, the character gains -4 to hit when firing, hitting as usual on a successful roll. If the attack misses because of the melee modifier, the attack is still a hit, but the target is determined randomly among the engaged characters. 

Significantly larger characters or monsters in a mêlée count as two characters for random targeting purposes, and truly gargantuan creatures can be fired upon using the normal rules.
##### Firing into Crowds
If the character wishes so, they can shoot a group of other characters standing together. If doing so, the character gains +1 to hit for each target after the first one. If the attack is successful, the target is determined randomly among the engaged characters. 

Significantly larger characters or monsters in a mêlée count as two characters for random targeting purposes, and truly gargantuan creatures can be fired upon using the normal rules.
##### Aiming
If using a missile weapon, a character can decide to take a full Round to aim. The aiming character has no Dexterity modifiers to his AC. On the following round the aiming character receives a +2 to hit when firing on his action. The aiming time is in addition to normal reload times.
##### Cover
Cover is protection behind something that can actually block incoming attacks, such as a wall or arrow slit. A quarter cover improves the AC by 2, the examples of it are bushes, and curtains, which rather obscure vision than block projectiles. A half-cover grants a +4 AC bonus, its examples are shallow trenches, thin wooden hedges and other objects which either partially block line of sight, or present moderate defense against the incoming projectiles. A three-quarter cover improves the AC by 7, the examples are either conceal most of the Character's body completely, like the trench, or are able to block some serious projectiles with mantlet being the most common example. The most common full cover example is a murder hole or an arrow slit in the stone building, such cover grants a +10 bonus to AC.
##### Parry
Characters can decide to defend themselves in combat at the expense of all other possible activity. Player is free to decide that their character is parrying at any point during the Round, even out of Initiative sequence, provided that the character has not yet acted. This gives a +2 AC bonus for the Round or +4 AC if the Character is wielding a Martial or a Specialist weapon.
##### Mounted Combat
Mounted characters receive +1 to hit (unless using minor or small weapons) and a +1 AC bonus when in melee combat against enemies on foot. Mounted characters receive a –5 penalty to hit with missile fire while mounted. Mounted Charge with a polearm triples the damage inflicted, and the polearms also triple their damage when counter-attacking.
##### Cast a spell
Casting a spell during combat is a very risky proposition because the caster leaves himself completely helpless and open to attack while doing so. Magic-Users must be able to speak freely to cast a spell. Clerics must also have their holy symbol in one hand for the entire Round. 

Spells take effect at the beginning of the next Round before the Initiative is rolled. If a character has taken any damage earlier in a Round, the character cannot cast a spell that Round.
##### Use an Item
Character might want to use some item in their possession, taking time according with the item availability:

| Item availability       | Time to get ready |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- |
| In hands or on the belt | None              |
| In a pouch              | 1d3+1 Rounds      |
| In a sack or a backpack | 3d6 Rounds        |
During this time, the Character can be attacked as an unaware opponent; if the Character defends themselves with their normal AC, the Round does not count as searching for an item as they are concentrating on avoiding being hit rather than readying the desired item. It is not a good idea to sit there and rifle through one’s pack while somebody is trying to kill you.
##### Hold Action
Sometimes winning the Initiative over a foe is not all that advantageous because it is important to know what the opponent is going to do before deciding for oneself. Any action can be held until the end of the Round, and at the time the action is taken, it happens simultaneously, not before other actions are taken. For instance, if waiting for an enemy to close later in the Round before attacking, when that enemy closes both attacks happen simultaneously; the one holding his action does not act first.
