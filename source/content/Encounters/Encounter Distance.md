Encounters begin with the closest opposing characters 3d6×10' apart, unless there are specific details which would define the encounter distance, such as being in fog or a forest. In environments with limited visibility (such as underground), the maximum encounter distance will be the visibility distance.

Note that creatures that can see in the dark and have ranged combat capabilities will certainly attack from beyond the range of their opponents’ vision.
