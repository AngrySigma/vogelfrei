### Initiative
At the start of each round, one player rolls 1d6 for the player characters’ side, and the Referee rolls 1d6 for each opposing party. The sides act in order of decreasing roll result. In a situation when the Characters are opposed by a single party, player rolls a d6 and the results of 1-3 mean the opposed side acts first, while the results of 4-6 mean that the Characters are allowed to act first.

If opposing groups roll the same Initiative number, break ties using additional d6 rolls, but in this case all actions occur at the same time. For that purpose, consider all damage and spells are applied at the end of both parties action, thus allowing for mutual murders and so simultaneous spell effects.

### Actions
Each character can perform a single action on their turn. These given options certainly do not contain an exhaustive list of possible actions. The Referee has the final say in what can or cannot be done in one Round.
#### Move
A character can move their full movement rate at any round using either normal movement speed, or running one. In case the Character is running through reach of any opponent who did not yet attack that turn, they may perform an attack against the Character.
If the Character moves their normal combat distance, they can perform a usual Attack afterwards. If the Character runs in a straight forward without obstacles at least half of their normal combat speed, they can perform a melee Attack with Charge afterwards. 
#### Attack
A Character can move their normal combat speed and perform an attack any enemy within their range. To determine the attack success and the inflicted damage, the following actions are performed:
* The Referee will inform the player what the opponent's AC is. The base AC is 10 with addition of Agility Bonus. Armed Characters add their Weapon Skill to AC against melee attacks. Using a shield or wielding a secondary weapon also modifies the AC.
* The player rolls a d20 to determine if the attack lands.
* Weapon Skill and Strength Bonus are added to the roll in melee, Ballistic Skill and Agility Bonus are added to the roll in ranged combat.
* Any result equal to or greater than the defender's AC results in a successful attack.
* The difference between the result rolled and the AC is subtracted from defender's Armor Rating.
* Attacker rolls their weapon damage die and subtracts the defender's resulting Armor Rating.
Some special conditions may modify the usual attack flow:

| Special Condition                        | Modifiers                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Attacking Unaware Opponent               | +2 to hit, enemy loses all modifiers to AC                                            |
| Attacking an Unarmed Character           | +5 to hit                                                                             |
| Attacking a Character with Longer Weapon | Enemy may attack first or gain +2 AC, if did not act this round.                      |
| Attacking a helpless Opponent            | Automatically deal max weapon damage in melee                                         |
| Attacking in Charge                      | Double damage dealt, gain -2 AC until next Round. Counter-thrust is resolved as usual |
| Attacking after Weapon Change            | -2 to hit                                                                             |
| Attacking with Double Team               | +2 to hit                                                                             |
| Attacking with Triple Team               | +5 to hit                                                                             |
| Wrestling in Team                        | +1 for each attacker, only the best roll applies                                      |
| Firing into Melee                        | -4 to hit, hit other random opponent, if the modifier makes the attack miss           |
| Firing into the Crowd                    | +1 to hit for each target after the first one                                         |
| Attacking after Aiming Round             | +2 to hit, lose Agility Bonus to AC while Aiming                                      |

#### Counter-thrust
If a Character attacks an opponent wielding a longer weapon, for example, an axe against a spear, the defender may perform a counter-thrust. Opponent must not have already acted that Round and after the counter-thrust they do not gain another action. If they choose not to attack, then they gain +2 to AC instead against that attack.
#### Charge
If the character runs the whole distance in a straight line without obstacles, they can perform a charging attack, doing double damage, but suffering a –2AC penalty for that Round. For long weapons, usual counter-thrust can be performed, and some weapons, that can receive a charge, do double damage for that attack.
#### Change Weapons and Attack
If a character is not holding the weapon that he wants to use, he can drop what is in his hands and draw a weapon (assuming the weapon is in an accessible place such as on a belt scabbard). There is a –2 penalty to hit during the Round that this happens.

#### Wrestling
A character may attempt to wrestle another character to either immobilize or take something out of that character’s hands. The attacker must have both hands free or wield a weapon effective for grappling. The defender, if he is armed and has not yet acted during the round, can immediately make an attack against the aggressor before the wrestling attempt is resolved.

Wrestling is resolved with a contested roll. Both parties roll 1d20 and apply both their Weapon Skill and Strength modifier. Ties are decided by Dexterity modifier, or a die roll if both are still tied. The winner decides whether the loser is immobilized, if he will attempt to disarm the loser of the contest, or if he releases the loser. An immobilized opponent can usually take no action other than attempting to escape on his next action, but can instead attack a grappling opponent with natural or minor weapons. Resolve this with another wrestling roll. Any character immobilized for three successive wrestling contests is considered pinned and helpless—no further attempts to escape can be made. If disarmament is attempted (and this includes snatching any held object, not just taking away weapons), the defender must make a save versus Paralyzation to keep hold of the object that his attacker is attempting to take.

If there are multiple opponents attempting to wrestle a single defender, all attackers make their rolls as normal, but only the best roll is used with a +1 bonus for each additional attacker. Creatures whose physiology or special abilities suggest that they have an advantage when grappling (tentacles, adhesive, multiple limbs) gain a further +1 bonus to their wrestling roll per Hit Die.
#### Firing into Melee
Firing into melee with a missile weapon is a very uncertain thing. If doing so, the character gains -4 to hit when firing, hitting as usual on a successful roll. If the attack misses because of the melee modifier, the attack is still a hit, but the target is determined randomly among the engaged characters. 

Significantly larger characters or monsters in a mêlée count as two characters for random targeting purposes, and truly gargantuan creatures can be fired upon using the normal rules.
#### Firing into Crowds
If the character wishes so, they can shoot a group of other characters standing together. If doing so, the character gains +1 to hit for each target after the first one. If the attack is successful, the target is determined randomly among the engaged characters. 

Significantly larger characters or monsters in a mêlée count as two characters for random targeting purposes, and truly gargantuan creatures can be fired upon using the normal rules.
#### Aiming
If using a missile weapon, a character can decide to take a full Round to aim. The aiming character has no Dexterity modifiers to his AC. On the following round the aiming character receives a +2 to hit when firing on his action. The aiming time is in addition to normal reload times.
