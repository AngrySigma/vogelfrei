### Roll Ability Scores

Roll 3d6 for each ability score (Strength, Toughness, Agility, Intelligence, Willpower, Leadership) in order, and record them on your character sheet.
A player can decide to swap the position of one ability score that was rolled with another.
Each ability score has a Modifier which is associated with it:

| Ability Score | Modifier |
| ------------- | -------- |
| 3-4           | -2       |
| 5-7           | -1       |
| 8-13          | 0        |
| 14-16         | +1       |
| 17-18         | +2       |
### Explanation of Ability Scores
**Leadership**
Leadership is the measure of a character’s aptitude for gaining obeyance and the respect that others bestow on the character’s authority. It is not a measure of the appeal of a character’s personality (the player must portray the character’s personality) nor a measure of the character’s beauty. Leadership modifiers affect the character’s ability to hire retainers and secure their loyalty.

**Toughness**
Toughness is the measure of a character’s health, vitality, and overall constitution. Toughness modifiers affect a character’s Wounds and fitness for certain physical activities such as travelling long distances.

**Agility**
Agility is the measure of a character’s mobility and reflexes. Agility modifiers affect a character’s ranged and mêlée defence, ability to hit with ranged weapons, and ability to act first in combat.

**Intelligence**
Intelligence is the measure of a character’s knowledge prior to the start of play. Intelligence does not measure a character’s memory or ability to solve puzzles; it is the player’s wits that must be used in these situations. Intelligence modifiers affect the character’s ability to learn languages, are added to saving throw rolls against Magic-User spells, and for Magic-Users it affects the time (and thus expense) required to research spells and create magic items, as well as influencing the saving throws of those subject to the Magic-User’s spells.

**Strength**
Strength is a measure of a character’s raw power. Strength modifiers affect a character’s ability to hit in mêlée combat, open stuck doors, or succeed in unarmed combat.

**Willpower**
Willpower is the measure of a character’s connection to the greater universe, and the strength of the character’s spirit. Wisdom modifiers affect the character’s non-spell related saving throw rolls, and for Clerics it affects the time (and thus expense) required to research spells and create holy items, as well as influencing the saving throws of those subject to the Cleric’s spells. Willpower cannot tell if a character should flee the battle or fight to death, it is the player’s own judgement which must be used in these situations.

#### Is the character suitable?
If the total of all of the character’s ability score modifiers is less than zero, then the player may discard the character and begin the process again.
