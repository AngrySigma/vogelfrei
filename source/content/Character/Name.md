A character’s name is, after his character class, perhaps the most important identifying feature of a character. The Referee should inform players as to the general theme of the campaign, and it is important to choose a name that will complement that theme.“Bernard Fitzwilliyam” would not be appropriate if a Referee has declared that the upcoming game is set in the barbaric wastes, for instance. A character may be around for quite some time, so care should be taken when choosing a name.
