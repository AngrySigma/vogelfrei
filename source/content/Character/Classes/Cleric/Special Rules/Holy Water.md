## Creating Holy Water
Water that is to be made into holy water must first be at rest in a basin in a place holy to the Cleric’s religion. Then, at the same time every day for nine days straight, a Bless spell must be cast on the basin and its contents. On the tenth day, the water must be placed in a vial, and then the tenth Bless cast upon it. Only then can it be used to combat the unnatural and the evil.

Most “holy water” used in religious rituals and services is merely symbolic. While suitable for its purpose, it does not have any potency against the undead or otherworldly creatures unless this ritual is performed.
