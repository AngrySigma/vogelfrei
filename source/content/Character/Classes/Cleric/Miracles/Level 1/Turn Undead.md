**Duration**: 1d4+2 Turns  
**Range**: 120'

One true measure of divine power is the command over life and death. In particular, power over the walking dead. They are abominations, a crime against creation. One of a Cleric’s first duties is to ensure that the dead shall dead remain. And so they have the power to first ward against, and later outright destroy, these creations.  

When the spell is cast, the Cleric’s player rolls 2d6. The Referee will then reference the result on the Turn Undead table on the previous page. If the roll is less than the listed number, then the undead are seemingly unaffected (but see below).

First column is a Cleric level, others are Undead Dit Dice.

If the roll is greater than or equal to the listed number, then undead totaling no more than 1d6 + the level of the casting Cleric in Hit Dice will flee to the best of their ability for the duration of the spell. Surplus Hit Dice are lost (so if the Cleric is turning four creatures of two Hit Dice each, and the roll is a 7, then only three are turned). If there are undead of multiple Hit Dice values, only one roll is made, and the roll is applied to all types. Lower Hit Dice undead are always turned before greater Hit Dice undead.

- A “T” signifies that no roll is necessary; the undead are automatically turned.
- A “D” signifies that the power of the Cleric is so great that the undead are instantly destroyed, rather than turned. Alternatively, a Cleric can instead choose to command the undead, making them the Cleric’s loyal slaves until destroyed. Note that intelligent undead creatures are allowed a saving throw versus Magic to avoid a “D” result; if successful, the creature is simply turned.
- A “–” signifies that a Cleric of that level cannot turn an undead creature of that many Hit Dice.
- An asterisk (*) denotes that twice the usual number of undead are turned.

If the turning was successful and there are still unturned undead remaining, the Cleric can roll to turn additional undead every Round until they fail a turning roll or the spell ends.

Regardless of the result, as long as the Cleric is concentrating (neither movement nor fighting nor other spellcasting allowed) and holding their holy symbol before them, undead creatures cannot approach within ten feet of them. If already within that distance, they will back away.
