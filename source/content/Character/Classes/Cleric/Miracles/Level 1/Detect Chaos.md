**Cleric Level 1**
**Duration**: Instantaneous
**Range**: Line of Sight

This spell allows the caster to know if anything within their field of vision (or on their person) is **Chaotic**. For the purposes of this spell, Chaotic is defined as, but not limited to:  

- **Undead creatures**
- **Any extra-dimensional or extra-planar creatures**
- **Any creature with innate magical abilities**
- **Artifacts, symbols, or sacred places dedicated to evil gods**
- **Supernatural creatures incapable of being good**

Mortal creatures, physical objects not directly connected to evil deities, traps, poison, or places where great atrocities have taken place are **not** considered Chaotic or evil for the purposes of this spell. It detects **supernatural disturbances**, not **ill intent or foul deeds**.

Curiously, this spell **does not detect magical items or effects**.  

The **reverse of this spell, Detect Order, detects Order instead of Chaos**.
