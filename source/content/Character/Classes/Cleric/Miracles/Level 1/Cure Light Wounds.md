**Duration**: Instantaneous  
**Range**: Touch  

By the power of the Clericâ€™s faith, this spell restores **1d6 Hit Points** to one damaged character, plus a number of points equal to the level of the caster. For example, if the caster is **5th level**, the spell restores **1d6+5 Hit Points**.  

The spell can also be used to remove **one temporary negative condition** instead of restoring lost Hit Points. For example, if a character is **paralyzed, stunned, or blinded** for a set period of time, this spell will remove any of these conditions. It will **not** work on permanent conditions, and only **one condition (or damage) can be treated per casting** of the spell.  

Recipients of the spell can only be restored to their **normal maximum Hit Points**, and no more. Any excess restored points are lost.  

The **reverse of the spell** can only be used to inflict damage.
