**Cleric Level 1**
**Duration**: Instantaneous
**Range**: Touch

This spell bestows the favor of the Cleric's deity upon the subject. That subject receives a number of points (1d6 + caster's level) to allocate to any future die rolls — To-Hit, saving throws, skill checks, surprise checks, whatever the subject desires — except damage rolls. The subject trades the points on a one-for-one basis and can adjust the roll by that many points however they see fit. The number of points to be used on a roll must be declared before the roll is made. All unused points are lost at dawn the following day.

No rolls relating to damage or anything concerning the use of magic use can be modified by Bless. Elves and other intrinsically magical creatures cannot benefit from Bless.
