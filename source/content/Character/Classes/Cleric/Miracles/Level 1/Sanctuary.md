**Cleric Level 1**  
**Duration**: 2 Rounds/level  
**Range**: Touch  

This spell allows the subject to be attacked less often by foes. Any creature attempting to attack the subject must first make a saving throw versus Magic, or else it is not permitted to make an attack. The attacker does not lose its turn; it can still attack another target, move, or do anything else it is normally allowed to do. This restriction applies to area effect attacks as well, unless there is another target within that area.

The spell ends immediately if the subject makes any violent or offensive action.
