**Duration**: 1 Round/level  
**Range**: Touch  

The subject of this spell becomes more resistant to Chaotic creatures and effects. Any Chaotic creature suffers a penalty to hit the subject in mêlée combat equal to the level of the caster, and the subject gets a +1 bonus per level of the caster to save against any attack or effect caused by a Chaotic creature. Protection from Chaos also allows a saving throw against Magic-User spells and effects against the subject which normally do not grant saves (spells which deliver damage do half on a successful save, other spells fail entirely on a successful save), but the subject must also save against the effects of the beneficial spells they want to be cast on them.

For purposes of this spell, “Chaotic creatures” include undead creatures, monsters with any sort of magical ability or attack, any creature that is able to use magic (including Magic-Users and Elves, but not Clerics), beings carrying magical items (potions and scrolls do not count, but wands and staves do), and any sort of supernatural creature incapable of acting beneficently.

Beings and manifestations that have no real-world essence without the forces of Chaos or magic (incorporeal undead, demons, extra-dimensional beings, Elves, etc.) are not able to physically touch those protected by this spell at all.  

The reverse of this spell, Protection from Order, instead protects against creatures of Order and Cleric magic.
