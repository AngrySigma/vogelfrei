**Duration**: 1 Turn/level  
**Range**: Touch  

The subject of this spell becomes completely unnoticed by undead creatures for the duration of the spell. Undead creatures cannot see, hear, or smell the subject at all for the duration of the spell or until the subject does something to intentionally gain an undead creatureâ€™s attention (including attacking). This breaks the spell completely, with all undead in the area being then able to sense the subject.  

The reverse of this spell, **Undead Attraction**, causes all present undead to ignore all living beings other than the subject until the subject is dead or until one of the ignored beings attacks the undead.
