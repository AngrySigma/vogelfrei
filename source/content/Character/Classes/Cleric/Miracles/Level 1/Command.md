**Cleric Level 1**
**Duration**: 1 Round
**Range**: 10'

When a Cleric casts this spell, he can give the subject a single word command, which it obeys to the best of its ability. The single word must make sense as a single command, such as approach, drop, fall, flee, halt, surrender, sleep, etc. Although a target could be instructed to die, this will only make the target collapse into a comatose state for a single Round. Note that the caster must be able to speak the language of the target. Any intended target that has more than 5 levels or Hit Dice, or an Intelligence of over 12 is entitled to a saving throw versus Magic. This spell is ineffective against undead.
