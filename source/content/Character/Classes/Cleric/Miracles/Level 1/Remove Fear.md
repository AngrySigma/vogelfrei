**Duration**: See Below  
**Range**: Touch  

This spell instills courage in the subject, and potentially removes the effect of magic-induced fear by allowing the target a saving throw versus Magic to attempt to remove the effects. The subject receives a saving throw bonus of +1 per level of the caster. The subject automatically succeeds in any morale checks for a number of Rounds equal to the caster’s level. Remove Fear spell counters and dispels Cause Fear.

The reverse, **Cause Fear**, will cause a subject who is touched to run away, hysterical, at full running movement for a number of Rounds equal to the caster’s level.
