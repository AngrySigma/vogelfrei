**Cleric Level 2**  
**Duration**: 7 Rounds  
**Range**: 40'  

Those who would dare take up arms against the gods' chosen shall burn. This spell targets one opponent and causes all metal arms and armor (including impromptu weapons!) to become hot enough to burn flesh. As insurance against hypocrisy, the caster's arms and armor heats up as well.  
On the first Round of the spell, the metal becomes warm and uncomfortable to touch, but deals no damage. The same effect also occurs on the last Round of the spell's duration. During the second (and also the next-to-last) Round, intense heat causes pain and damage. In the third, fourth, and fifth Rounds, the metal is searing hot, causing more damage, as shown on the table below:

| Round | Metal Temperature | Damage   |
|-------|-------------------|----------|
| 1     | Warm              | None     |
| 2     | Hot               | 1d4      |
| 3â€“5   | Scorching         | 2d4      |
| 6     | Hot               | 1d4      |
| 7     | Warm              | None     |

Note that when searing damage is delivered, additional effects occur depending on the body parts which are in contact with metal. A target may experience more than one of these effects if metal is contacting multiple body parts. Effects are as follows:  
- **Extremities** (hands, feet): unusable  
- **Body** (covered by metal armor): bedridden from extreme burns  
- **Head** (covered by a helmet): severely burned, victim is unconscious  

These effects remain until the damage caused by the spell heals. If searing metal makes contact with flammable material (leather, cloth, etc.), it burns, dealing an additional **1d4 damage** on the next Round.
