**Class**: [[Academic]]
**Status**: Brass

**Skills**: [[Skills#Heal|Heal]], [[Skills#Sleight of Hand|Sleight of Hand]], [[Skills#Languages|Languages]], [[Skills#Lore|Lore]]

***Trait***: You can perform surgery. On a successful Heal check, use the same d6 roll to shorten a Minor Wound’s recovery time. The roll result equals the number of days, weeks, or months reduced, depending on the wound. If a wound specifies “surgery required,” a Heal check must succeed to save the limb; failure results in amputation.
