**Duration**: d4 Turns  
**Range**: 30' + 10'/level  

A Sleep spell causes a magical slumber to come upon creatures with 4+1 or fewer Hit Dice. The caster can only affect 1 creature if it has 4+1 or more Hit Dice, but the spell will otherwise affect creatures totaling no more than 2d8 Hit Dice. Calculate monsters with less than 1 Hit Die as having 1 Hit Die, and monsters with a bonus to their Hit Dice as having the flat amount. For example, a 3+2 Hit Die monster would be calculated as having 3 Hit Dice. Excess Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. Creatures with the fewest Hit Dice are affected first. Slapping or wounding awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not. Sleep does not affect undead, constructs, or other magical or unnatural creatures (such as Elves).
