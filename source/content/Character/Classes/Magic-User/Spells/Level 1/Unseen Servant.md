An Unseen Servant is an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs simple tasks at the casterâ€™s command. It can run and fetch things, open unstuck doors, and hold chairs, as well as clean and mend. It can open only normal doors, drawers, lids, and the like. It can lift 20 pounds or drag 40 pounds. The Servant cannot attack in any way, and it cannot be killed because it is a magical force, not a living thing.
