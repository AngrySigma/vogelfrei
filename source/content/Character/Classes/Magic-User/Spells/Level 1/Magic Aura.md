**Duration**: Permanent  
**Range**: Touch  

This spell makes an object appealing to the microcosmic forces of magic, giving the item an aura that causes it to register to Detect spells (and spells with similar capabilities) as though it were magical. If the object bearing **Magic Aura** is physically examined (touched), the examiner recognizes that the aura is false if he succeeds in a saving throw versus Magic. Otherwise, he believes the aura, but no amount of testing reveals what the true magic is.  

The reverse of this spell, **Obscure Aura**, hides the magic aura of a legitimate magical item. A Magic-User casting [[Detect Magic]] and actually handling the item is permitted a saving throw versus Magic to see the magical aura of the item.
