**Magic-User Level 1**  
**Duration**: Instantaneous  
**Range**: 60' + 10'/level  

This spell grants the caster the ability to whisper messages and receive whispered replies. The caster points his finger at a creature he wants to receive the message. The target must be in direct line of sight, with no barrier. The whispered message is audible only to the target. The creature that receives the message can whisper a reply that the caster can hear. The spell transmits sound, not meaning. It does not transcend language barriers. Unlike casting most spells, the gestures of this spell are subtle, and it is easy to conceal that the spell is being cast.
