**Magic-User Level 1**  
**Duration**: Instantaneous  
**Range**: 30'  

Mending repairs small breaks or tears in objects. It will weld broken metallic objects such as a ring, a chain link, a medallion, or a slender dagger, providing but one break exists. Ceramic or wooden objects with multiple breaks can be invisibly rejoined to be as strong as new. A hole in a leather sack or a wineskin is completely healed over by Mending. The spell cannot repair magic items, nor does it affect creatures.
