**Duration**: 2d6 Turns  
**Range**: 10'  

This spell magically holds shut a door, gate, window, or shutter of wood, metal, or stone. The magic affects the portal just as if it were securely closed and normally locked. A **Knock** spell or a successful **Dispel Magic** spell can negate a **Hold Portal** spell.
