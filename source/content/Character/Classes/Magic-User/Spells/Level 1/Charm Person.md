**Duration**: See Below
**Range**: 120' 

The Charm Person spell makes a single subject utterly enamored with the caster and desperate to please them if the saving throw versus Magic is failed. This is not mind control, as the subject retains their personality and control how they act but for their utter fascination with the caster. The caster must articulate their desires if they expect the subject to fulfill them. 

Any request which is not against the subject’s interests or personality will be followed. Any  
request which is against the subject’s interests or personality triggers a saving throw to refuse the  
request. If the saving throw is successful, the request will be refused, but this will not break the Charm. If as part of a request, the caster promises the subject something that the subject is normally inclined to want, then this saving throw is not necessary, and the subject will comply.  

This spell works on all humans and human-like creatures (except Elves); other (non player character class) humanoids are not affected if they have more than four Hit Dice. Abuse or neglect of the subject will trigger another saving throw to negate the Charm, and murderous violence towards the subject also triggers a save, but with a +5 bonus to the roll. The subject, if intelligent, will realize that he has been victim to mesmerism, and retain full memory of their actions while under the Charm after the spell ends.
