**Duration**: Instantaneous  
**Range**: Line of Sight  

This spell allows the caster to know if anything within their field of vision (or on their person) is in any way **magical**. This includes:

- **Magical creatures**  
- **Magical items**  
- Any creature or object under the effect of an ongoing spell  

Spellcasters such as **Magic-Users** and **Elves** do **not** detect as magic with this spell, but anyone under the effects of an active spell does. The spell **does not** identify the nature of the magic, only that magic is present.  

The caster must already be able to **see the object** in question in order to detect it as magical. **Concealed, covered, or invisible objects will not be revealed** by this spell.
