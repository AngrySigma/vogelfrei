**Duration**: 2 Rounds/level  
**Range**: 80'  

A pale glow surrounds and outlines the subjects, making them hypervisible. Outlined subjects shed light that makes them visible in darkness at a distance of **80'**, or half this if the creatures are near a light source. The Magic-User can affect creatures within a **40' radius**, and may outline up to **one human-sized creature per caster level**. The Faerie Fire can be **blue, green, or violet**, according to the Magic-Userâ€™s choice at the time of casting. The Faerie Fire does not cause any harm to the objects or creatures thus outlined. However, their greater visibility grants attackers a **+2 bonus to hit them** while the spell is in effect.
