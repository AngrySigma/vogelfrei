**Duration**: 1 Round + 1 Round/level  
**Range**: Touch  

The subject can climb and travel on vertical surfaces or even traverse ceilings as a spider does. The affected creature must have its hands and feet free to climb in this manner. Any objects weighing less than 5 pounds cling to the spell recipientâ€™s hands and feet. This spell can be used on another being (touch required) with no saving throw.
