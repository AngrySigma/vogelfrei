**Magic-User Level 1**  
**Duration**: 3 Turns/caster level  
**Range**: 120'  

This spell creates a light source equivalent to that of a torch in the target area of the spell. The effect is immobile if cast on an area, but if cast on an object, it moves with the object. Once cast, the caster has no control over the light but can end the spell if he so wishes. If cast on a person or on the equipment of a person who does not wish to be the target of the spell, that person is allowed a saving throw versus Magic; success means that the spell is cast on the area the person is in, but not on a particular object.  

The light caused by the spell emits no heat, nor can it be extinguished by water or high winds. The source of the light can be covered, which will block the light, but this will not end the spell.  

**Darkness**, the reverse of the spell, causes an area to be covered in total darkness; even creatures able to see in the dark are blind here.  

The spell can be targeted at a creatureâ€™s eyes specifically to blind it, assuming it has eyes in close proximity to one another. The target gets a saving throw versus Magic. If successful, the spell fails to work at all.
