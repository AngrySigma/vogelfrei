## Beginning Spells
At the start of play, every Magic-User’s spellbook  contains Read Magic plus three other randomly-determined first level spells. An Elf begins play with only Read Magic in the spellbook. Upon attaining a new level, a Magic-User can add one random spell to his book free of charge from his choice of spell levels he is already able to cast, but the time for researching or transcribing the spell remains as standard.

## Preparing Spells Each Day

REWRITE

A Magic-User must rest for six continuous hours before preparing spells. After resting, the Magic-User must study using a spellbook for a number of hours equal to the highest level spell being prepared. This process is sometimes called memorizing spells. Spells remain in memory until they are cast, and once they are cast, they fade from the mind like a dream upon waking. However, the same spell can be prepared multiple times. The Magic-User’s spell chart gives the maximum number of spells that can be memorized at each level and the Magic-User can never have more than this number prepared at one time. Spells cannot be simply dismissed from the mind; they must be cast to clear the “spell slot.” Reversible spells are effectively two different  spells: the “normal” version and the “reversed” version. They must be researched, transcribed, and  prepared as different spells. A Magic-User can only safely prepare spells once every twenty-four hours. The mind simply cannot handle any more. Magic-Users can only prepare spells which are written in their spellbooks.
## Casting Spells
Spells are cast by a combination of mental effort, gesticulation, and incantations. In order to cast a spell, a Magic-User must be able to recite the incantation freely. A character that is gagged, Silenced or otherwise unable to speak cannot cast spells. Casting a spell cannot be done secretly, stealthily or disguised as another activity if otherwise not stated. The actions necessary to cast a spell will be obvious to all. Magic-Users cannot cast spells if they are more than Lightly encumbered if otherwise not stated.

In order to cast a spell, a player rolls a d6.. A spell is successfully cast if the total number rolled exceeds the target Casting Number.

If the total number is lesser than the Casting Number, the spell just fails. If there is any 1 on the dice rolled, or any pair, triplet or quartet is present, the miscast occurs with its strength depending on the roll. The Referee must decide on the miscast outcome with reference to the table below. Miscast spells might still be cast, yet the outcome will likely not be as desired. In case a spell is cast successfully and a miscast happens, the miscast is resolved first and then the spell effect takes place.

| Miscast                                         | Effect |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Minor: One on any die or any pair               |        |
| Major: A triplet or snake eyes                  |        |
| Catastrophic: A quadruplet or a triplet of ones |        |

- For any spells that harm a target or make any direct effect, a saving throw is allowed for a target character negating effect or halving the damage the spell produces.
- Заклинания поиска и обнаружения до 3-го уровня не способны преодолеть три фута грязи или густых зарослей, один фут камня, один дюйм металла или тонкий лист свинца. От подобных заклинаний выше 3-го уровня может помочь только специальная магическая защита.
* Spells of CN 10 and lower level that search and reveal anything, cannot penetrate 3 ft of dirt or  debris, 1ft of stone, 1’’ of metal or a thin sheet of lead. Detection by spells of higher CN can only be prevented by special magical defence.

## Channeling
High-level spells are particularly difficult to cast at once. They do not only require perfect concentration from the Magic-User, but also the right amount of magical power gathered from the Winds of Magic. Any Magic-User is able to use their action to channel the Winds and make the cast more manageable. While the character is channelling, the player rolls a d6 and adds it to their channelling pool. Channelling may continue for any number of rounds and may be stopped under the following circumstances:
- A character decides to cast a spell using the gathered Winds
- A character has gathered a quartet in their channeling pool leading to an instant catastrophic miscast
- A character is attacked, pushed, or other event, such as a nearby explosion, distracts them from channelling further. In that case, save from Paralyze may be attempted to continue channelling.
- A character willingly stops channelling to perform other actions
In case the channeling is interrupted, the pool is lost and channeling must be started anew. If any ones, pairs, triplets or quartets are present, the appropriate miscast occurs. Unless the Winds were used to cast a spell, for each dice in the pool, Magic-User and all the characters in the 20ft vicinity of them get d6 damage, halved if the save vs Breath is passed.
