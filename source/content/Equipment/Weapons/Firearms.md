All Firearms requirements as stated in [[Class and Career#Weapon Requirements|Weapon Requirements]] are the same and depend on the lock type:

| Lock Type           | Requirement                      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Matchlock           | Specialist                       |
| Wheellock           | Martial                          |
| Flintlock           | Martial                          |
| Engineering Weapons | One step higher than noted above |

### Weapon Traits
Firearms share the following special traits:
* Firearms suffer double the usual range penalties: -4 to hit at Medium Range and -8 to hit at Long Range.
* Most of the common firearms can be used as melee weapons, their equivalents listed in the table. Such weapon use applies -1 penalty to usual weapon defense characteristic. Muskets and Long Rifles can be equipped with a bayonet, allowing them to be used as a Spear. Bayonets are manufactured for individual weapon, count as a Minor Weapon by itself and require 1 Round to be plugged into the barrel.
* All Firearms ignore 5 Armor Rating when fired at Short Range. Muskets and Long Rifles gain this benefit at any range.
* Discharge of a Firearm causes an immediate Morale Check for all enemy characters and creatures with a Morale of 7 or less.
* All Firearms have a base chance of Misfire, depending on a lock type. Any misfire requires three rounds to clean before attempting to fire again.
* Some weapons, such as a Duck Foot Pistol or a Pepperbox, have variable number of barrels. Base number of barrels is 3, with a new one added at half the cost of a firearm.

| Duck Foot Pistol | When fired, all targets in range have to pass a Paralysis Save or get d6 damage, assuming no Armor is penetrated. Range penalties are used to modify the Saving Throw. Maximum amount of targets equals to the number of weapon barrels.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Pepperbox        | After each shot, may be rotated to use the next loaded barrel, allowing the wielder to fire again on the next Round.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Repeater Pistol  | After each shot, rotates the loaded barrels using the shot inertia, allowing the wielder to fire again on the next Round.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Hand Mortar      | When firing that weapon, AC is always 15, the Shield modifies the on-hit Paralysis Save. If the hit roll misses, the difference between the AC and the roll is equal to the number of yards the shot flies away in a random direction. Distance can not be larger than half the distance between the wielder and the target. Wherever the hit lands, all characters within 10 yards must pass the Paralysis Save or get d8 damage, assuming no Armor is penetrated. |

## Lock Types
### Matchlock
Matchlocks are considered the default gun type, and other firearm types are considered modifications and upgrades of the matchlock for rules purposes.
Matchlocks use the following rules:
* Reloading a matchlock requires 10 rounds minus the Character's BS and Agility modifier. Characterâ€™s Encumbrance value is added to the reload time. Any round in which the character moves or defends themselves (using their regular AC when attacked) does not count towards the reload time.
* They have a 2 in 10 chance of misfiring.
* A lit match burns 10cm per turn (from each end it burns!), and the light and smell that the burning match gives off makes stealth impossible.
* Damp conditions (most dungeons count as being damp) double the chances of misfiring (which in this case means the powder is too wet to ignite).
* Wet conditions (rain, etc.) quadruples the chances of misfiring (powder too wet to ignite).
* Wet cord or powder cannot be used until it dries.
### Wheellock
Wheellock modification to the firearms rules:
* Have no additional misfire chances due to environmental conditions.
* Increase the base cost of a gun sevenfold.
* Have a 1 in 4 chance of having the firing mechanism break if used as a club.
* Does not require a burning match, allowing for stealth movement.
### Flintlock
Flintlock modification to the firearms rules:
* Only a 1 in 10 chance of a misfire.
* Double the base cost of a gun.
* Halve reload times after accounting for the BS and Agility modifier.
* Does not require a burning match, allowing for stealth movement
### Rifled Barrel
Rifled guns are slower to load as the same thing that controls a bullet leaving the barrel makes it impossible to quickly jam shot, powder, and wadding down the barrel in the first place.
Rifling:
* Eliminates the increased range penalties of firearms.
* Doubles the base cost of a gun.
* Reloading time of a gun increases by half after BS and Agility modifiers have been applied.
***Note***: cost multipliers are cumulative, so a rifled wheellock musket would cost 60spÃ—7Ã—2=840sp
