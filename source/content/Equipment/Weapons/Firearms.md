### Pistol
Pistols are about the size of a man’s forearm. One pistol counts as an item for encumbrance purposes, but two pistols, called a brace, only counts as one item for encumbrance  purposes. A pistol requires one hand to fire. Pistols never use the matchlock firing mechanism. A pistol can be used as a mêlée weapon, inflicting 1d4 points of damage.
### Handgun
Period firearms terminology defied strict definition, but for our purposes here, the handgun is a handheld long gun which does not require a fork rest in order to fire properly. A handgun requires two hands to use.
A handgun can be used as a mêlée weapon. This requires two hands and inflicts 1d6 points of damage.
### Musket
For our purposes, the musket is a large handheld long gun which requires a fork rest in order to fire; not having the rest levies a –2 penalty to hit. Muskets count as oversized items for encumbrance purposes. Muskets require two hands to use.
A musket can be used as a mêlée weapon. This requires two hands and inflicts 1d6 points of damage.

## Lock Types
### Matchlock
Matchlocks are considered the default gun type, and other firearm types are considered modifications and upgrades of the matchlock for rules purposes.
Matchlocks use the following rules:
* They ignore 5 points of Armor at short range (at all ranges for muskets and long rifles).
* The discharge of a firearm causes an immediate Morale check for all enemy characters and creatures with a Morale of 7 or less.
* Reloading a matchlock requires 10 rounds minus the Character's BS and Dexterity modifier. Character’s Encumbrance value is added to the reload time. Any round in which the character moves or defends himself (using their regular Armor class when attacked) does not count towards the reload time.
* They suffer double the usual range penalties at Medium and Long range (so –4 and –8 to hit, respectively). Dexterity to-hit modifiers do not apply for Medium or Long range targets.
* They have a 2 in 10 chance of misfiring (meaning that the powder discharges, but the bullet does not fire). A misfire will require three rounds to clear before attempting to fire again.
* A lit match burns 10cm per turn (from each end it burns!), and the light and smell that the burning match gives off makes stealth impossible.
* Damp conditions (most dungeons count as being damp) double the chances of misfiring (which in this case means the powder is too wet to ignite).
* Wet conditions (rain, etc.) quadruples the chances of misfiring (powder too wet to ignite).
* Wet cord or powder cannot be used until it dries.
Note that this misfire roll adds a complication to combat. An easy way to handle it when a player character is targeted by someone wielding a matchlock is to declare that the player controlling the target must roll the misfire die at the time that the attack roll is made. If the player forgets, then there is no chance to misfire, but everyone will have an interest in remembering to make the misfire roll without the attacker needing to worry about it.
### Wheellock
Wheellock modification to the firearms rules:
* Have no additional misfire chances due to environmental conditions.
* Increase the base cost of a gun sevenfold.
* Have a 1 in 4 chance of having the firing mechanism break if used as a club.
* Does not require a burning match, allowing for stealth movement.
### Flintlock
Flintlock modification to the firearms rules:
* Only a 1 in 10 chance of a misfire (flash in the pan, but the bullet is not fired).
* Double the base cost of a gun.
* Halve reload times (Fighters round down, all others round up).
* Does not require a burning match, allowing for stealth movement
### Rifled Barrel
Rifled guns are slower to load as the same thing that controls a bullet leaving the barrel makes it impossible to quickly jam shot, powder, and wadding down the barrel in the first place.
Rifling:
* Eliminates the increased range penalties of firearms.
* Doubles the base cost of a gun.
* The reloading time of a gun increases by half.
***Note***: cost multipliers are cumulative, so a rifled wheellock musket would cost 100sp×7×2=1400sp
