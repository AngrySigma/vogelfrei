The generic “weapon” categories are only for rules and reference purposes. Characters purchasing such an item must specify exactly what sort of weapon is being purchased.

Silver weapons cost ten times more than standard weapons, and have a 1 in 10 chance to break whenever they are used to attack, even if the attack misses.

Some weapons can attack “from the second rank.” This is used when there is a definite battle line in combat. Usually only those on the front line of battle can strike, but those weapons usable from the second rank allow anyone immediately behind the battle line to strike as well.
