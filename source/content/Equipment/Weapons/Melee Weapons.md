### Weapon Traits

| Weapon       | Effects                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Garrote      | Use of this weapon requires an attack from surprise, or a successful grapple. If a hit is scored, the target is considered grappled and will take 1d6 damage per round.                                          |
| Lance        | This weapon can be used one-handed if charging on horseback. Otherwise, it is effectively a pike polearm.                                                                                                        |
| Mancatcher   | A successful hit with this weapon requires the victim to pass a Paralysis Save or become helpless, as is the wielder of the mancatcher while the target is being held for purposes of defending against attacks. |
| Polearm      | This weapon can be used to attack from the second rank or to receive a charge.                                                                                                                                   |
| Spear        | When wielded in both hands, this can be used to attack from the second rank or to receive a charge.                                                                                                              |
| Whip         | This weapon is ineffective against targets with in metal armor, but allows melee attacks on opponents up to 10' away.                                                                                            |
| Weighted Net | A successful hit with this weapon requires the victim to pass a Paralysis Save or become helpless. A new Paralysis Save is allowed on each next Round.                                                           |

Some weapons can attack “from the second rank.” This is used when there is a definite battle line in combat. Usually only those on the front line of battle can strike, but those weapons usable from the second rank allow anyone immediately behind the battle line to strike as well.

### Silver Weapons

Silver weapons cost ten times more than standard weapons, and have a 1 in 10 chance to break whenever they are used to attack, even if the attack misses.
