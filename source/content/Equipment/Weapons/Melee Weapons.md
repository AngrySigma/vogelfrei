- Cestus: This includes all sorts of fist wrappings and brass knuckle weapon types. Users suffer a –2 penalty to hit any opponent with an unadjusted AC of 15 or better.
- Garrote: Use of this weapon requires an attack from surprise, or a successful grapple. If a hit is scored, the target is considered grappled and will take 1d6 damage per round.
- Lance: This weapon can be used one-handed if charging on horseback. Otherwise, it is effectively a polearm (pike).
- Mancatcher: A successful hit with this weapon requires the victim to make a saving throw versus Paralysis. If unsuccessful, the victim is considered helpless, as is the wielder of the mancatcher while the target is being held for purposes of defending against attacks. This weapon must be wielded with two hands.
- Polearm: This two-handed weapon can be used to attack from the second rank, can be used to receive a charge, and receives a +1 bonus to hit opponents with an unadjusted AC of 16 or better.
- Rapier: This one handed weapon suffers a –2 penalty to hit opponents with an unadjusted AC of 15 or better.
- Spear: This can be used to attack from the second rank, and can be used to receive a charge.
- Staff: This must be wielded with two hands.
- Weapon, Great: These weapons must be wielded with two hands. Two-handed swords, mauls, and great axes are included in this category.
- Weapon, Medium: These weapons include standard swords, battle axes, and maces. Halflings must wield them two-handed.
- Weapon, Small: These are one-handed weapons, including short swords and hand axes.
- Weapon, Minor: These are small one-handed weapons including daggers and clubs, and suffer a –2 penalty to hit opponents with an unadjusted AC of 15 or better.
- Whip: This weapon is ineffective against targets with unadjusted AC 14 or better, but allows mêlée attacks on opponents up to 10' away.
The generic “weapon” categories are only for rules and reference purposes. Characters purchasing such an item must specify exactly what sort of weapon is being purchased.

Silver weapons cost ten times more than standard weapons, and have a 1 in 10 chance to break whenever they are used to attack, even if the attack misses.

An “unadjusted” Armor Class is that of solely the armor and shield. Dexterity modifiers, magical modifiers, or any other adjustments are not counted when determining unadjusted AC.

Some weapons can attack “from the second rank.” This is used when there is a definite battle line in combat. Usually only those on the front line of battle can strike, but those weapons usable from the second rank allow anyone immediately behind the battle line to strike as well.
