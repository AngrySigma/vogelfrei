#### Holy Water
Holy water can be sprinkled on an opponent within mêlée range, and the opponent will always be considered AC10 in this situation unless using actual armor and/or shield. This takes up both the attacker’s hands and actions for the full Round.

Holy water, if in a glass container or flask, can be thrown with the same range modifiers as a rock. If it hits, it will only break and unleash the holy water 75% of the time. Otherwise it simply does the same damage as a thrown rock.

Holy water inflicts 1d8 damage against appropriate targets such as undead, summoned creatures, innately magical beings such as Elves, etc.

#### Oil and Fire
Lobbing flasks of flaming oil is a popular tactic of explorers. Here is how that works:
The oil flask must be in hand, its lid or stopper removed, and a wick of some sort (usually a bit of cloth) already prepared and lit.

Lamp oil is not napalm. If a creature is subjected to ignited lamp oil, it will suffer 1d4 points of damage. If the damage roll is 4, then the victim must make a saving throw versus Breath Weapon or else suffer another 1d4 damage on his next action. If that roll is a 4 as well, then the victim becomes engulfed in flames.

A creature completely engulfed in fire is in trouble. The creature suffers 1d8 damage per Round until he either dies, or the fire is put out. Creatures who are alight usually react by immediately fleeing in search of water, or failing that, simply run aimlessly until collapsing.

Of course any fire has a chance to set alight wood structures or objects, not to mention material such as curtains, carpets, tapestries, etc.
