### Ability Score Loss

Loss of ability scores only affects the character so much as their modifiers and bonuses will change. A character dropping from Strength 13 to Strength 12 will no longer have any Strength modifier, for example. This is most striking with Constitution, as any change in Constitution modifier is applied immediately to both current and maximum Wounds.

A character who falls to zero in any ability score dies.

### Aging

Characters who grow old will lose their faculties and eventually die. The chart below gives the starting age that characters must make a saving throw versus Paralyzation, at what ages there are penalties to the modifier, and how often the saving throw must be made. A failed saving throw means that one randomly determined ability score will permanently decrease by one point.

| Race     | Interval         | No Modifier | -2  | -4  |
| -------- | ---------------- | ----------- | --- | --- |
| Dwarf    | 5                | 200         | 250 | 300 |
| Elf      | Elves to not age |             |     |     |
| Halfling | 1                | 70          | 80  | 100 |
| Human    | 1                | 40          | 50  | 60  |
If a character is aged by magical means, then all saving throws that would have needed to be made if the aging occurred naturally must be made immediately, with any ability score penalties also being applied immediately.

### Damage

When a character (or creature) suffers damage, the amount of damage is deducted from the character’s current Wounds. When his Wounds go below 0, the character falls prone, and becomes unable to take most actions. Characters can still crawl being unable to stand up, and perform simple actions which do not require any stamina, such as attacking, casting spells or invoking miracles. Reaching state below 0 Wounds causes critical injury according to the table below by rolling 1d10 and adding the number of negative Wounds reached (for example, if a Character had 2 Wounds and got 4 Damage, it sends them to -2 Wounds, thus triggering an injury roll of 1d10+2). Any damage received when the Character is below 0 Wounds, instantly kills any character.

### Disease

Characters exploring in godforsaken ruins, ancient tombs, and trackless wilderness can become exposed to all sorts of plagues and illnesses. Natural, chronic illnesses will not normally be a part of the game as far as player characters are concerned. That said, the Referee is free to introduce an NPC stricken by cancer or some other illness.

Diseases are individual in nature, but all have the following characteristics: incubation period, infection time, interval, and effect.

When exposed to a disease, the Referee will make a save versus Poison on behalf of the character. If the save fails, then the character has contracted the disease. The incubation period describes the length of time before the character is affected, and at that point the character must make another save, and then another save at every interval point for the duration of the infection time, or else suffer the effect for each failed save. Each save after the disease is contracted is made with a –2 penalty if the character is not at rest for the duration of the infection.

For example, the Green River Fever has an incubation period of one week, an interval of four hours, an infection time of three days, and the effect of lowering Intelligence. So beginning one week after a character has been infected, that character must make a saving throw versus Poison every four hours for three days (a total of 18 saving throws), or lose a point of Intelligence for each failed save.

### Drugs & Alcohol

Drugs are treated much as poison would be, but the effects of a failed saving throw (no save if intentionally using drugs) are usually much less severe than death. The Referee will determine the effects of specific drugs in his campaign.

Alcohol is far more pernicious, as it is quite common for most everyone to use it to excess, as

beer and wine are often safer to drink than plain water. Teetotalers will be extremely rare. Drunk

characters are –2 to Dexterity and all saving throws.

### Falling

Characters suffer 1d6 points of damage per 10' that they fall, up to a maximum of 20d6 for a 200' fall.

### Poison

There are a variety of ways that a character can become poisoned. When exposed to poison, the

character must make a saving throw against Poison or suffer the effects. Typical effects of a poison are instant death, falling into a deep slumber, the loss of Wounds, or perhaps the reduction in one or more ability scores. Only all-or-nothing effects are considered to be poison. Poisons that cause gradual or incremental effects are considered to be drugs for rules purposes.

### Starvation

A character must eat at least one full meal a day and drink water every day or suffer ill effects. For every 24 hours that a character goes without food, the character must make a save versus Poison or one Constitution point is lost. For every 24 hours that a character goes without water, his

Constitution drops by half unless he makes a save versus Poison. After three such failed saves against Poison due to a lack of water, the character will be dead. Constitution losses due to dehydration or starvation recover at twice the usual rate with rest and proper nourishment.

### Sleep Deprivation

A character must sleep at least four hours per twenty-four hour period in order to function properly. If this is not the case, the character suffers a –1 penalty to all rolls (10% penalty for 1d00% rolls) until the situation is corrected. If the character continues on further without taking adequate sleep, there is a cumulative –1/10% penalty for each additional day that passes without proper rest being taken.

### Traps

Dungeons and ruins frequently contain traps, including spear-throwers, covered pits, etc. The Referee will decide what is required to trigger a trap, and what happens when the trap is triggered. In general, there must be some way to avoid or reduce the effect of the trap being sprung. For

instance, a save versus Paralyzation is often used to avoid falling into a covered pit, while spear-

throwers, automated crossbows, and the like are sometimes treated as if they were monsters (attacking the victim’s Armor Class at a given Attack Bonus).

Any character can use the Search skill (base 1 in 6 chance) to determine if an area or object has any secret mechanism or function, including traps. A successful use of this skill does not tell what the function is (it may very well be something that the character should want to trigger!), but will let the character know that it is there and how it is triggered. The search takes one turn per 10' square searched.

Trap detection may not be allowed if the trap is purely magical in nature; on the other hand, in such cases Magic-Users, Elves, and/or Clerics may be able to detect magical traps at the given 1 in 6 chance, at the Referee’s discretion.

## Healing

Damaged characters who have at least half of their Wounds remaining recover 1hp after a peaceful

night’s rest. Taking a watch shift does not prevent this recovery unless something happens during the shift. Damaged characters who have at least half of their Wounds remaining can also recover an additional 1d3 hp by resting a full day. To count as a full day of “rest,” a character cannot engage in any strenuous activity, including, but not limited to traveling, fighting, researching, running, searching, hunting, or foraging, and the character must have adequate food and water. Basically, the character can do no more than converse and walk around his immediate area.

Characters who have less than half of their Wounds remaining are in worse shape. They recover nothing from a night’s rest, and recover only 1hp by resting a full day.

A character at zero or fewer Wounds will wake up after 1d6 hours. The character will not be able to carry any equipment or stand up, but can communicate and crawl at a movement rate of 10'.

If the character rests the entire day in a comfortable bed in a clean room, then an additional 1hp is recovered.

Characters who have suffered temporary ability score loss recover at a rate of one point (for all affected ability scores) per day of rest. All affected ability scores regain an additional point at the end of a full week of rest.

Characters can make no recovery if resting in a dungeon or similarly hostile environment.

Healing restores Wounds and ability scores only to their normal maximum, never more.
