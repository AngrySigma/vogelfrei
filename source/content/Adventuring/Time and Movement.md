## Time

Within the game, time passes as is convenient for play. If the characters are simply waiting for whatever reason, then the Referee can say, “Two days pass,” or whatever is needed. If nothing of importance happens, then players merely mark off their characters’ food supplies or upkeep costs as appropriate, and handle any other business that occurs during that time.

There are periods when keeping a strict record of time is important. Most measures of time are self-explanatory in the rules, as they match our real measurements of time. However, there are three units of time that have special meaning in the game.

The “Turn” is ten minutes long. This is often used as a measure of time for spell durations and underground exploring.

The “Round” is ten seconds long. This is primarily used for time management during combat and for the duration of combat-oriented spells.

The “Segment” is one second long. During each round of combat, characters will act in different orders. The exact moment when a character’s action occurs is called the “Segment.”
