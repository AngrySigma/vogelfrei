### Falling
Characters suffer 1d6 points of damage per 10' that they fall, up to a maximum of 20d6 for a 200' fall.
### Traps
Dungeons and ruins frequently contain traps, including spear-throwers, covered pits, etc. The Referee will decide what is required to trigger a trap, and what happens when the trap is triggered. In general, there must be some way to avoid or reduce the effect of the trap being sprung. For instance, a save versus Paralyzation is often used to avoid falling into a covered pit, while spearthrowers, automated crossbows, and the like are sometimes treated as if they were monsters (attacking the victim’s Armor Class at a given Attack Bonus).

Any character can use the Search skill (base 1 in 6 chance) to determine if an area or object has any secret mechanism or function, including traps. A successful use of this skill does not tell what the function is (it may very well be something that the character should want to trigger!), but will let the character know that it is there and how it is triggered. The search takes one turn per 10' square searched.

Trap detection may not be allowed if the trap is purely magical in nature; on the other hand, in such cases Magic-Users, Elves, and/or Clerics may be able to detect magical traps at the given 1 in 6 chance, at the Referee’s discretion.
