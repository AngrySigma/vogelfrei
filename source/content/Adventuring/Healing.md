Damaged characters who have at least half of their Hit Points remaining recover 1hp after a peaceful night’s rest. Taking a watch shift does not prevent this recovery unless something happens during the shift. Damaged characters who have at least half of their Hit Points remaining can also recover an additional 1d3 hp by resting a full day. To count as a full day of “rest,” a character cannot engage in any strenuous activity, including, but not limited to traveling, fighting, researching, running, searching, hunting, or foraging, and the character must have adequate food and water. Basically, the character can do no more than converse and walk around his immediate area.

Characters who have less than half of their Hit Points remaining are in worse shape. They recover nothing from a night’s rest, and recover only 1hp by resting a full day.

A character at zero or fewer Hit Points will wake up after 1d6 hours. The character will not be able to carry any equipment or stand up, but can communicate and crawl at a movement rate of 10'.

If the character rests the entire day in a comfortable bed in a clean room, then an additional 1hp is recovered.

Characters who have suffered temporary ability score loss recover at a rate of one point (for all affected ability scores) per day of rest. All affected ability scores regain an additional point at the end of a full week of rest.

Characters can make no recovery if resting in a dungeon or similarly hostile environment.

Healing restores Hit Points and ability scores only to their normal maximum, never more.
